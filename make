    <h1>The Kingdom Access System</h1>
    <p>A Story of God's Control Through RBAC</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Owner – God the Father</h2>
    <p>
      In every system, the <strong>Owner</strong> has full control of the backend. In life, God the Father is the true Owner.
      He holds the master key to all creation.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “The earth is the LORD’s, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.” (Psalm 24:1)
    </blockquote>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Administrator – Jesus Christ</h2>
    <p>
      When sin corrupted the code of humanity, Jesus Christ—the <strong>Admin</strong>—came to restore access. He alone can
      reset the broken systems of our lives.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.” (Matthew 28:18)
    </blockquote>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>User-Defined Role – The Holy Spirit</h2>
    <p>
      Like a defined system role, the <strong>Holy Spirit</strong> works in the background. He encrypts our prayers, guides
      us into truth, and protects us from the enemy’s attacks.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth.” (John 16:13)
    </blockquote>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Reader – Humanity</h2>
    <p>
      Humanity has limited access—like a <strong>Reader</strong>. We can view, testify, and experience, but we cannot edit
      God’s master plan. Our role is to trust and obey.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Apart from me you can do nothing.” (John 15:5)
    </blockquote>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Closing Message</h2>
    <p>
      Your life is secure in God’s access system. You may be a Reader, but you serve a God who is the Owner. You walk with
      Jesus, the Admin who can rewrite your story, and you are guided by the Holy Spirit, your Helper.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “We are not system owners; we are readers of God’s script. Our greatest security is knowing the Owner of life holds the master key.”
